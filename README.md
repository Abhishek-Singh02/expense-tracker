# Expense-Tracker
Good Money Management is an extremely important life skill to have, so that's why I took the initiative to make my very own Expense Tracker using Reactjs and MongoDB Database.

With Expense-Tracker, you can add/remove your daily expenses with ease. This app uses database, so it won't clear the data upon session refresh. The purpose of this project creation was so that I can get in more practice when it comes to working with React and React Libraries. This application is fully functional. 

I completed it with the following: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query , Material UI, ExpressJS, NodeJS and MongoDB.
